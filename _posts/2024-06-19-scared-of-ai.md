title: Why are you, as a developer, scared of AI?

Developers that are around me are very, *very* smart.

Most of them started with one language, but have been learning, and pushing to production, a different language every 2-3 years.

Those who started as backend devs have either gone deep on the server side, also learning DevOps, networking, server management in the process, or went the full stack route and got dangerously good with frontend.

Some devs who started on frontend web or mobile, learned both mobile and web development, some turned into people who can design as well, some went the full stack route.

These people are just constantly learning, adapting, changing with the environment.

Most of them are in some sense self taught. They have picked up skills on the job, or through side projects.

They're generally very hardworking people, willing to change their opinions on tools, while vehemently defending them (the famous language wars!).

Now when it comes to AI, why are they scared that it'll take their jobs?

If history is to be believed, they can (*and will*) reinvent themselves with the constant learning that happens as part of their routine.

Sure, they're a bit older now, but that just means that learning new tools is that much easier now.

If you are a developer that somewhat identifies with the above description, don't worry about AI taking your job.

Just be really good at your craft, keep learning, give a fuck about your work, and you'll see your value going up and to the right.
