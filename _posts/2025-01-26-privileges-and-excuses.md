title: Privilege isnâ€™t your problem, Excuses are

Recently I wrote about privileges on twitter and wanted to expand on that.

It started when someone said that a friend who reached 100K followers, did so because she had pretty privilege. I could recognize that that's not true (not the pretty part, but that being the reason) because I know she has been making content in some shape and form on the internet for very long, and it was just a matter of time before something works.

Men are especially sour about this thing where they perceive that women have pretty privileges because of which they gain an audience.

That may or may not be true, but what I've learned is that you need to exploit your privileges, also called your **unfair advantages**, to get ahead in life.

Then someone wrote that you can't gain followers without this privilege (so there is no point putting in the efforts).

Tanmay Bhat grew in popularity when he was obese, not objectively attractive by conventional sense.

Dolly Chaiwala doesn't look attractive as well, neither does CarryMinati. Each of them figured out what they actually have an advantage in and levered the fuck out of that.

Why is it ok to leverage being funny, that comes naturally to you, but not ok to leverage your looks?

Then there were some people who believe others get ahead because of their privileges but they don't possess any. They wrote that on twitter, in English.

15% people in India speak English fluently. If you learn to speak English, you stand to make 30% more than other who don't. You have that privilege.

You live in a city. That's a huge privilege. Your expenses would be higher, but earning potential is much more.

You have access to Internet, which 45% of the Indian population doesn't ([source](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/45-of-indians-still-do-not-access-internet-iamai-kantar-study/108035843)).

You're on twitter/Linkedin, presumably you have a laptop or smartphone, you're ahead of 50% people with just this access.

It's very easy to blame your lack of agency on privilege. Doing that does no good to you. It just gives you a reason to convince yourself that you will fail, so the pain of inaction is reduced.

Believe in yourself.
