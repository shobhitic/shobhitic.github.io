Mark Zuckerberg is being trolled today because he said that average american has 3 friends and has demand for 15, which he plans to deliver via AI friends.

People are saying stuff like:

> The average American has 3 eggs, but has demand for 15. So here are 12 photographs of eggs. I am a business man.

> "The average American has 3 friends. Our job is to get that number to 0."

> The very very very very worst people to shape the future of humanity seem to have all the power to shape the future of humanity. And nobody cares

What people seem to miss is that they can just not use these AI bots?

There are plenty of services that Facebook has launched which did not see any real usage. This can be one of them as well.

I don't think Zuck or anyone has the power to shove it down your throats even when you don't want to use them.

If people really want to talk to a machine, they will talk to a machine. And it's not going to be because Zuck forced you to talk to a machine.

You are still very much free to not talk to a machine and talk to real humans and make 15 friends rather than 3 by yourself.

That option will still be there!

People just forget they have agency, or a right to vote with their wallet/time.
