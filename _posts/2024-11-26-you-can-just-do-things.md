Default is that nothing happens.

Or that you fall into a habit that doesn't serve you.

Doing things is a muscle in itself. Doing things more makes it easier to do more things.

Finding and doing things is how you develop high agency. High agency is how you excel.

There is no shame in doing things, even if it is low quality. In fact, obsession with quality is mostly an excuse for not doing things. Plus, quantity leads to higher quality anyway.

If you can just do things, you can also just NOT do things you don't want (like eating sugar).

You might have skill gaps, so you might do the thing badly, but doing them is the way to improve your skills.

And if you don't do the thing, it won't get done.

You can just do things. You must just do things.
