<!-- How do you react to a change? -->

Yesterday evening, a new Software Engineer called [Devin](https://twitter.com/cognition_labs/status/1767548763134964000) launched.

All the developer communities I am part of were lit with discussions around Devin. Lots of people are scared that this is the end of software development jobs.

Under the hood, it is doing what every developer does. Read the problem statement, break it down into chunks, find ways to solve those chunks (from memory, or from searching the internet), put them back as code, and deploy the changes.

Looks like a better, focused version of [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) and [Baby AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi).

What is really impressive is that it was able to make changes to code that was already written, like an open source repo on GitHub. Prior to this, all the AI demos were about creating a new project, and after that they basically left you to it.

It does look scary on the surface. But don't forget that [AI is a productivity tool](/ai-taking-jobs).

You have to learn to use whatever tool you can, to be productive. These productivity gains will make you more valuable.

#### **You've been using a hand-axe to cut down a tree, and somebody has just invented the chainsaw.**

People who learn how to master the chainsaw will survive, and others will perish.

Good news is that everyone is at the same point in this race, and most of your competition is lazy.

Can you adapt?
