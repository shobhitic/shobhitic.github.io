There are bunch of people out there who **HATE** the QR code menus in restaurants and cafes.

I am ***NOT*** one of them. I kinda like them. Let me share why :-

1. No need to bother the waiting staff.
2. No limit on number of menus.
3. Doesn't take up space on table.
4. Not unhygienic (or as hygienic as your phone).
5. No pressure to place an order quickly.
6. Easy to read in the dark (like at a bar).
7. Photos to show me what food looks like.
8. Searchable.
9. Organised in categories (like Pizza, Pasta, Dessert, etc).
10. No need to wait for menu to arrive.
11. No one takes the menu away.
12. Easy to pay without waiting for bill.
13. Can add food to cart, no need to remember it in my tiny brain.
14. Restaurant removes unavailable food.
15. Introvert friendly.

I even try to find the restaurant on delivery apps to be able to use the digital menu to find what I want to eat, at places that don't have QR code menu.

It is also beneficial for restaurants. They can change menu swiftly, change prices, collect customer information, etc.
#### **What do I not like?**

Places that make you download a PDF of 50MB from Google drive, which is a scanned copy of their physical menu, and you need to pinch zoom the PDF to find anything.

Or places where you need to call the waiter to get an OTP!?

**Those are the worst.**
