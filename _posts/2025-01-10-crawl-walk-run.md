When I start a new project, I don’t aim for perfection anymore.

I focus on the smallest effort needed to build momentum. Changing momentum—whether increasing or decreasing it—takes effort. But once it’s there, it’s easier to keep going. And I’m lazy, so I like momentum.

Want to write a book? Start with a tweet about your idea, write more tweets that can be converted to blogs and then a book.

Want to sell software? See if it can done as a service first, then automate things while performing the service and then build the whole software.

Want to get fit? Stop eating ice cream.

(Trust me, I used to eat three ice creams a day. Not a good idea.)

If you stop eating ice cream every day, you’ll naturally lose some weight. Once that happens, maintain the new weight for a while. Let it become part of who you are. Then take the next step to improve further.

Step jumps are easier than straight lines in my opinion. After all, staircases are easier to climb than a straight slope.

That said, not everyone needs to crawl first. Some people can fly right away. If that’s you, go for it! Why get rich slowly if you can get rich fast?

But remember, directly flying has lower odds of success. Crawling, walking, and running take longer but give you a better chance of reaching your goal.

So, choose your approach. Crawl for stability. Fly for speed.
