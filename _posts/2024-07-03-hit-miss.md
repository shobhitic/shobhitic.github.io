There are some days where everything goes right. You don't feel tired after your workout. You don't have any dependency issues. All your code compiles in the first try. All your clients want to book a call for a new project with you.

Then there are the days where you just can't make any progress. None. Nada. Zilch.

You barely get into your workout and just leave after a small treadmill session. The code you write is utter garbage, and the software it makes is disastrous. The call your clients booked with you are to delay a payment.

It feels like the world is moving forward at an incredible speed, and you're being left behind.

This post is for those days.

You don't need to worry about any of this shit. You just need to keep going. Keep making progress, however small.

Just do more rep, one more cold email/call, write one more test and make it pass.

Time is on your side. Go slow, but don't stop. Stay in the game!

That's the highest probability method in our hands to win!
