Inertia (or its positive cousin, Momentum) is a super power that you can use to make progress feel much easier and more comfortable.

My team decided that we will go deep on Model Context Protocol (MCP) 3 weeks ago.

We started by building servers daily. Once that became routine, we moved on to clients.

We kept running out of things to make, but our previous work unlocked new capabilities for us. That allowed us to build more difficult things and got us even closer to mastering the protocol.

At this point, I am fairly confident that we as a team understand a lot of trade offs, pros and cons of the protocol.

We can ship anything quickly. We are able to innovate new patterns. And also find ways to leverage the tech in other areas for our clients.

Inertia means tendency to remain unchanged. To continue in existing state unless acted upon by an external force.

We started with inertia. It took us a couple of days to push through. But once we did, inertia worked in our favor again. We started building daily. People call it momentum, but it's really just inertia; what remains after the force has been applied and then removed.

We had to go on a trip and get our heads into this thing, but that force allowed us to shift our inertia from inaction to action.

Now we are worried we'll run out of things to experiment with. ðŸ˜…

Inertia is powerful. You need to apply force to change the nature of inertia, but once done, it becomes easy to be in that state of inertia (i.e. constant momentum).

Don't underestimate it. Wield it to your advantage!
