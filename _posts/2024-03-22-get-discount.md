title: Can I get a discount?

Few years ago, I remember watching a video on YouTube where the guy goes up to a barista and asks for a discount. Simple steps, just go to the cashier, place your order, and ask for a discount.

As a self certified introvert in real life, this was fascinating to watch. I don't even bother bargaining with shop owners, where my Mom would get a 10-40% price reduction.

I just check the price, see if it is something fine with me, and move on.

There was always this fear of people judging you, thinking you're cheap, fear of rejection.

So when I saw a challenge to do exactly this in the [new book](https://noahkagan.com/mdwbook/) I am reading, in a moment of inspiration, I decided to take up this challenge.

I was (am) in Hyderabad today. After fucking up my Visa appointment by leaving passport back home, I went to a nearby Starbucks to beat the heat, and attend a couple of work calls.

I placed an order (butter croissant and strawberry milkshake). Cashier asked for my name (and wrote Toebith??). I asked for the bill amount.

Cashier: "â‚¹680 sir."

Me: "Oh. Can I get a discount on that? Like a 10% discount?"

Cashier was taken aback. They probably heard this request for the first time at Starbucks.

Cashier: "Why? Any problem?"

Me: "Oh no, I was just wondering if I can get a discount today."

Cashier: "No sir, but you can get our card, you get offers with that."

And that was that. Slowest 20 seconds of the day. But it was alright. I thought let's do another one.

I decided to spend rest of the day at a coworking space (as my return ticket was for the night).

I started calling coworking spaces. They did not have day passes, or empty spaces. One guy entertained my call though. He said he has a day pass, and empty seats today.

Me: "Great! How much will it be?"

Them: "â‚¹600 sir"

Me: "Can I get a discount on that? How about â‚¹500?"

Them: "Hmm.. I'll have to check. You first come and see."

Me: "Can you check and call back?"

They went to check but didn't call back. So I called back and this time, they were like **"Ok yeah, come, 500 is fine."**

Not a big thing in grand scheme of things, but made me realize it's not that scary to get rejected by strangers.

Up until recently, I could only do this online. Felt exhilarated doing in person, and not over async texts.

If you're scared like me, give this a try. Use the same script as me. Feel the growth happening in your body. ðŸ˜„
