In the morning, I slipped on the slope of my apartment building. In the process, I twisted my ankle.

There is a big swelling there. Went for a checkup to a doctor, he said there's a ligament called ATFL (Anterior Talo-Fibular Ligament) that has teared up. Also a bone in the ankle is not in the right place?

Anyway, prescribed a rest for 6 to 8 weeks. Advised to get an elbow crutch to help walk.

So now, I can't go for walks anymore. The one thing I was doing consistently since May 2022. Also, preparing to get bored af at home.

Here's to hoping an adventurous time!
