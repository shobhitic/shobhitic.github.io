This is for students, but even for seasoned devs.

I see so many people not learning something because they don't want to spend money.

The money needed to build things are very low these days. You can host apps in serverless fashion and only pay for your usage. Even GPUs are serverless. Great for getting started (and then please learn how to host it yourself).

Many people think their projects will blow up in popularity. It happens to < 0.01% overnight.

More realistically, it'll be you and your friends you begged to use, who will use it.

The return on this spend, in terms of career opportunities will be much more higher than anywhere you invest that money.

Worst case, you'll spend $100 (INR 8300) on learning something. You spent more than 100 times that on not learning anything in college any way!

Don't be afraid of spending money to learn and build. Just ship things.
