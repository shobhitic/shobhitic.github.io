title: Why I like paying for convenience

It's no secret that I am a heavy user of quick commerce apps like Blinkit.

Lots of people tell me that I am paying for delivery charges, I am paying extra for some products, the rates are a bit on the higher side on these apps.

But I am using these apps even after knowing these things.

Why?

Because my time has way more value!

I generally work 6 days a week. I am paid based on time, and the free time is used to promote me and my business.

Overall, I think every hour I spend unproductive (that could have been productive), I lose about ₹2,000.

My order value on the apps? About ₹3,000 per week.

If I plan my grocery trips, I can probably save ₹300-500 but spend 1-2 hours extra a week.

Is it worth it?
