I put artificial constraints on myself all the time, and then forget that they are artificial, and start believing that they're real.

When wanting to decide the topic of this essay, I kept thinking _"No I don't have enough words to say on that topic, even though I want to write about it"_.

I kept thinking -- why will people read something so small, so half baked?

I need a screenshot that looks long, so people will end up bookmarking the tweet rather than reading it, right?

Then I realized, these are just constraints I have put, for no reason, and I can break them whenever I want.

So here is my attempt at breaking them. I hope this essay was a very quick, small read.
