Blinkit is launching 10 minute delivery [for PS5 today](https://twitter.com/albinder/status/1776106719988351093).

Many people on twitter are asking why would someone need it? **Why do you need a PS5 in 10 minutes?**

With the growth of ecommerce, we've forgotten how things used to work. If I lived near a shop, buying any electronics would be a 5 minute affair, given I know what I want.

Compared to that, Blinkit is pretty slow.

I can go to Croma/Reliance Digital/Sony Center near my place and pick up the PS5 within 10 minutes. Why am I expected to wait longer if I order online?

This seems to be hangover from ecommerce deliveries taking a couple of days, which seemed fast in the early years of last decade, and now feel slow with the onslaught of items available for quick delivery on Blinkit/Instamart.

Why do I even need to wait for 10 minutes? How do we develop technology that we can get it delivered in 1 minute, with great economics for everyone involved?

I hope that 10 minutes start to seem slow with improvements in the coming years!
