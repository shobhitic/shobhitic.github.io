Today, I can't focus on any work for more than 5 minutes. I get an urge to check WhatsApp, Telegram, Twitter, Email, and what not.

This keeps breaking my flow, making it hard to do any meaningful knowledge work.

Even writing this essay has been a very difficult thing to keep focused.

This is what happens when your attention span is very small:

* You get bored reading any text longer than a page.
* You're distracted while watching any educational video.
* You're thinking of weird random things when you should be working.

People with higher attention span will learn more, retain more, and get more done.

They can also focus better on task at hand as a part of their mind is not occupied with other things.

If there's one thing you want to improve about yourself, start here. Improve your attention span. Learn to be bored. Seek it, handle it. If you get comfortable with it, it makes you much better than any of the competition over the long period.

How to improve it?

I am also searching for answers to that.

I try to have a boredom session during the day, but it hasn't really worked yet. Here's to hoping we crack this one!
