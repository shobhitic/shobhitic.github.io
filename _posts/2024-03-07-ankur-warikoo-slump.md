I had a very hard time reading books from 2020 onwards. I just couldn't focus enough to complete any book, or just read it for more than couple of pages.

I was always distracted, and kept getting lost in my thoughts. This made me read the words, but not register them at all, and suddenly I had no context on what I was reading.

Sometimes trying to find the meaning of the word on my phone distracted me. Sometimes trying to understand a sentence confused me..

These were both fiction and non-fiction books, but primarily non-fiction.

Then one day, a kind friend gave me [Ankur Warikoo's Do Epic Shit](https://www.amazon.in/Do-Epic-Shit-Ankur-Warikoo-ebook/dp/B09MTGKFXZ).

I was skeptical because it was fashionable to hate on his writing, content, and books, in my corner of the world.

I began reading the book, finding it very easy to pick up and read from start to finish.

Simple to understand sentence structure. Easy words. No fluff.

I think it was easy because he printed his LinkedIn content in a book format.

I built momentum in one sitting, and then just completed the book very quickly. The content was focused for people in their early 20s, but there were definitely some things which made me pause and think.

I recognized that losing momentum with reading was an issue, and picking up heavy books was a big problem. So I read _"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"_ and one of the Chetan Bhagat's book next.

And BAM! 3 books in 2 weeks gave me enough momentum to start increasing the workload, and just like that I got into the habit of reading again.

So, thank you Warikoo ji!

My mom visited me last month. She gets bored a lot at my place. I gave her this book and she read it in a week!

The only thing she didn't understand by herself was the meaning of cold calling/mailing. She thought it was something to do with the temperature, before I had to explain it. ðŸ˜¬
